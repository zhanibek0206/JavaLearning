LANGUAGE FUNDAMENTALS

IDENTIFIERS

1. Name in Java Programming Language called Identifier. Identifier can be "variable name", "method name" or "class name".

Sample code:

    public class Test {
        public static void main(String [] args) {
            int x = 10;
        }
    }

In this code 5 identifiers:
    1 - Test(name of class),
    2 - main(name of method),
    3 - String(name of class),
    4 - args(name of array),
    5- x(name of variable).

2. Rules for Identifiers

First Rule: As an identifier in Java, can use names that contains following characters: 'A to Z' or 'a to z', '0 to 9', $(dollar), _(underscore character).

If we're using another characters, then we'll get Compile Time Error(CE).

Example:

total_number - valid
total# - not valid.

Second Rule: Identifier should not start with number

Example:

total123 - valid
123total - not valid.


3. Third Rule: Java is a Case Sensitive Language. This means that Java distinguishes(различиает) uppercase and lowercase letters in identifiers.

For example:

    class Test {
        int Number = 10;
        int number = 10;
        int NUMBER = 10;
    }

Number, number and NUMBER are three different identifiers.

4. Fourth Rule. We can't use reserved words as identifiers

Example:

    int x = 10; - Valid
    int if = 10; - Invalid


5. Java allows use keywords as identifiers of variables, but it isn't recommended.

Sample Code:

    public class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int String = 888;
            System.out.println(String); // Print 888. Where 888 is a whole number
        }
    }

RESERVED_WORDS

1. In Java some words are reserved, it's 53 words: keywords(50) and reserved literals(3) - "true", "false" and "null".

2. Keywords of Data Types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char.

3. Keywords of Flow Control: if, else, switch, case, default, while, do, for, break, continue, return

4. Keywords of modifiers: public, private, protected static, final, abstract, synchronized, native, volatile,

5. Keywords of Exception Handling: try, catch, finally, throw, throws, assert

6. Class related keywords: class, interface, extends, implements, package, import.

7. Object related keywords: new, instanceof, super, this.

8. Return Type Keyword: void.

9. Unused keywords: goto, const.

10. "enum" keyword. The enum keyword in Java is used to declare enumerations. Enums represent a set of named values that are constants.

Conclusion: All 53 reserved keywords in Java contains only lowercase alphabetic symbols.
