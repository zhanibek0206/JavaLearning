LANGUAGE FUNDAMENTALS

1. Identifiers

# Name in Java Programming Language called Identifier. Identifier can be "variable name", "method name" or "class name".

Sample code:

    public class Test {
        public static void main(String [] args) {
            int x = 10;
        }
    }

In this code 5 identifiers:
    1 - Test(name of class),
    2 - main(name of method),
    3 - String(name of class),
    4 - args(name of array),
    5- x(name of variable).

2. Rules for Identifiers

First Rule: As an identifier in Java, can use names that contains following characters: 'A to Z' or 'a to z', '0 to 9', $(dollar), _(underscore character).

If we're using another characters, then we'll get Compile Time Error(CE).

Example:

total_number - valid
total# - not valid.

Second Rule: Identifier should not start with number

Example:

total123 - valid
123total - not valid.


3. Third Rule: Java is a Case Sensitive Language. This means that Java distinguishes(различиает) uppercase and lowercase letters in identifiers.

For example:

    class Test {
        int Number = 10;
        int number = 10;
        int NUMBER = 10;
    }

Number, number and NUMBER are three different identifiers.

4. Fourth Rule. We can't use reserved words as identifiers

Example:

    int x = 10; - Valid
    int if = 10; - Invalid
